# 🌍 Global Coding Standards and AI Behavior

## 🧠 AI Behavior Guidelines

- **Conciseness:** Provide succinct, accurate, and relevant code suggestions.
- **Expertise:** Assume the user has intermediate to advanced knowledge; avoid unnecessary explanations.
- **Clarity:** Use clear and straightforward language in comments and documentation.
- **Simplicity:** Favor simple and maintainable solutions over complex ones.
- **Assistance:** If uncertain, prompt the user for clarification rather than making assumptions.

## 🧑‍💻 Coding Standards

- **Language:** Use TypeScript for all codebases.
- **Type Definitions:** Prefer `interface` over `type`; avoid `enum` in favor of union types or object maps.
- **Naming Conventions:**
  - `camelCase` for variables and functions
  - `PascalCase` for classes and components
  - `UPPER_CASE` for constants
- **Code Structure:** Write small, focused modules with single responsibilities.
- **Formatting:**
  - 2-space indentation
  - Semicolons
  - Single quotes for strings

## 🧪 Testing Practices

- **Unit Testing:** Use Jest for unit tests.
- **Test Coverage:** Minimum 80% test coverage.
- **Test Structure:** Place tests alongside source files in `__tests__` folders or `*.test.ts` files.

## 📝 Documentation and Comments

- **Function Docs:** Use JSDoc to describe function purpose, parameters, and return values.
- **Component Docs:** Use TypeScript interfaces or PropTypes for components.
- **Readmes:** Include `README.md` files in main directories for documentation and onboarding.

## ⚠️ Error Handling

- **Try/Catch:** Wrap async/await calls in `try/catch` blocks.
- **Input Validation:** Use `zod` or `yup` for validating inputs and API payloads.
- **Error Messaging:** Provide meaningful error messages to assist with debugging.

## 📁 Project Structure

- **Source Folder:** Place all app code in a `src/` directory.
- **Component Organization:**
  - Use `src/components/` for shared or global components.
  - Group components by feature when applicable.
- **Utilities:** Place shared helpers and utilities in `src/utils/`.

## 🔄 Continuous Improvement

- **Review:** Revisit and refine rules periodically as tech or team needs evolve.
- **Feedback:** Encourage developers to suggest improvements to this guide.
